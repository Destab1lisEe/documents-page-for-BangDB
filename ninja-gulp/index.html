									<h2>Overview</h2>
								</div>
								<p class="text">BangDB is more than just a NoSql database. It is designed to help
									developers and users to solve problems with ease and speed and build powerful
									applications by focusing on the use case and leaving the rest of the heavy lifting
									to the database.</p>

								<p class="text">BangDB is a NoSql data platform which allows developers to ingest any
									kind of data into the system in streaming or batch manner, then analyze the data in
									absolute and probabilistic ways in order to take some actions to optimize the
									business operations. And do all these with very high speed to ensure continuous
									intelligence delivery out of the platform. BangDB could be thought as a converge
									data platform designed for the rapidly changing data trend and also to be resilient
									to tolerate future changes and requirements. NoSql + AI + Stream is a way to sum up
									the proposition.</p>

								<p class="text">When it comes to deal with the fast-moving data from devices, logs,
									clickstreams etc. we need to have streaming mechanism to easily ingest data.
									Ingestion alone will not do much as we need to continuously analyze data as it
									arrives. Therefore, we need to have timeseries data analysis system in place. It’s
									important to note that bringing another streaming system and integrating it with the
									NoSql will not be able to do the justice to both the “ease of use & faster time to
									market” from developers’ perspective and “continuous intelligence with sub-sec
									latency” from the use case requirement angle. Hence, we must have streaming
									component natively integrated within the NoSql itself.</p>

								<p class="text2">Similarly, more and more use cases are demanding predictive analysis
									which in turn requires machine learning or AI component. Again, in order to be able
									to train and predict on streaming data to achieve the goal of continuous
									intelligence, we must have AI component natively integrated within the NoSql itself.
								</p>

								</div>

								<p class="text2">Since we are talking about ingesting data from heterogenous set of
									sources, therefore it will not be possible to deal with upfront structuring of the
									data before ingestion can begin. At the same time, it will also be not prudent to
									define all data types in a singular structure. Hence if on one hand we need to worry
									about how to avoid structuring of the data then on the other hand we will need to
									employ more than one structure within the system down the stream in order to
									efficiently process, store and retrieve them. Therefore, multi modeling becomes
									important which allows us to deal with different data types in the same database,
									for ex; documents, timeseries, graph, opaque data etc. and at the same time it
									liberates us from putting brittle requirement of upfront structuring of the data.
								</p>

								<div class="image-wrapper">

								</div>

								<p class="text2">Most of these data are coming from sensors, devices, logs, machines,
									etc. which are hyper local in nature. In order to process these data, most of the
									contemporary solutions or platforms/tools, take all these data into some cloud or
									data center and then process it before taking any action. This method has many
									problems and people have realized it already. While on one hand we have problem of
									taking lots of data over the wire to the cloud or data centers, at the same time we
									lose the opportunity to act quickly and locally even though the data and insights
									were all there at the local level. Therefore it not only becomes inefficient, cost
									intensive but at the same time it becomes very hard to enable the hyperlocal use
									cases.
									Hence, we need to have system which is connected from local to cloud or data center
									with ability to process and analyze data at both local and cloud level. This
									architecture demands embedded computing and analytics with store.</p>

								<p class="text2">
									Further, most of the data platform in the market boasts of in-memory only platform.
									This to my mind is a limitation rather than a feature. Assembling lots of memory
									makes the proposition very costly and then irrespective of whatever is the size of
									memory, the system remains brittle in a sense that it will always require extra
									memory in order to process another byte beyond memory size. Therefore, we must get
									rid of the this “bug” and allow data to be overflowed to the disk. But going to disk
									makes the processing too slow and this was the main reasons why other platform went
									“in-memory” only approach.
								</p>

								<div class="image-wrapper">

								</div>

								<p class="text2">BangDB implements IO-Layer which sits on top of ext3/4 like file system
									and allows db to use SSDs to enhance the performance even when it overflows from
									memory to fs. Within a boundary, this mechanism allows us to go beyond memory and
									degrade gracefully for long period of time until the system scales for higher load.
									This especially very helpful for the scenarios where the system has to be designed
									for peak load even though that peak exists for tiny part of the computing life
									cycle. Further, it brings the needed flexibility and resilience when it comes to
									dealing for burst of data supply and system will not fail for the need of more
									memory but instead will handle the scenario gracefully and allow it to continue
									function without break. Finally, with the use of SSD is a particular way, overall
									cost gets reduced significantly since it no longer requires assembly of lots of
									memory upfront</p>

								<div class="image-wrapper">
									<img class="center-image2" src="img/image5.png" alt="">
								</div>

								<p class="text2">
									Therefore, BangDB is designed for all these trends and requirements and it has been
									developed from ground up in C/C++ to align with the use cases, requirements and pain
									points of the developers and users.
									We are in process of adding lot more binaries in coming days and we will be very
									aggressive in adding more capabilities and features. Since BangDB allows us to
									control the data and the way we deal with it, same should get transferred to the
									developers and users.
